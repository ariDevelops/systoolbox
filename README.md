# systoolbox
Unix/linux perlscripts for automate system tasks

This directory provides a set of automation perlscripts to handle the daily installation and management tasks of the developer/devops, 
providing the user to use simpler command line syntaxes instead of the traditional syntax rules that every tool requires.

I'm open to receive new ideas for my project, the idea of ​​systoolbox is to be a portable command line program box between implemented OSs, 
making it easier for the user not having to remember the same syntactic rules between different shells between systems many different.

as a novice and hobbyist in the area of ​​development and systems,
I sincerely thank those who come to contribute and share knowledge in my project.
